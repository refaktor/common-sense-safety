# Common sense safety

Notes and protocols for being relatively safe when using a computer. These are general guidelines mixed with personal choices, but we can extend on them, so propose changes if you have them.

## Operating system

I prefer to use Linux. It offers good baseline safety, if not for other reason because it's used less, and many tools to further enhance it. 

But both Mac and Windows invested a lot in security so I suspect there should be safe ways to use them. Comment of post a PR about them if you have information to contributte.

## Email

Many atacks start from emails:

* Viruses or other as attachments
* Phishing links
* Client volnarabilites
* Social engineering

Advice:

* Don't download and install or open locally any files that seem in any way suspicious or that you aren't sure the reason you were sent them!
* Email could be made in a way that it uses voulnarabilty in a email client. It's probably better to use webmail with a safe browser, perhaps FireFox.
